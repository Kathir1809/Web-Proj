# Web-Proj

This is project is made with Python-Django.
I used main two apps known as [ projects & users ]
Each apps has separate admin, apps, forms, models, tests, urls, utils and views
Project app is used for purpose of one of the part known as Projects in which it is responsible for the Projects to show in website..
The same applies to the users and which is responsible for the users in the website..
I used Postgres to store the Databases..
I used Supabase to store the data's online
I used backblaze to store the images which serves as Amazon S3 bucket.
This website is hosted on render in free tier.
